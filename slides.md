# Goals 

### Portal Metrics Dashboard
Currently, there isn't a good view on what the general member is interested in when they join ACM.
Because of the Portal project, we keep track of event attendance, which members are in which sub-organizations, as well
as other info, but this information is not aggregated into any useful information.

If elected, I plan on implementing an interface in Portal to view popularity of events, attendance in sub-orgs, and other
metrics, all over time.

### Portal + Discord integration

Part of tracking the interest in certain events lead by ACM is looking into Discord activity. Discord is a platform
whose API and documentation I have familiarity with, and I have also been an active contributor this past semester for
the Portal project.

If elected, I'd be able to leverage engagement towards events on Discord, and add more robustness to the view of what
our ACM members want.

# Collaboration and Help

### Contribution to in-house software
Getting integrated into working on projects such as Portal doesn't feel streamlined as a non-officer.

If all of this in-house software is to be not only contributed to, but even maintained in the future, more communication
around projects must be clearly visible to the public.

### Workshops and learning
There are too many people who seemingly have interest in working on projects who are not tended to. 

Full-stack workshops hosted this semester are an amazing way to get people over the initial hump in software development,
and more workshops like these, as well as more spontaneous one-on-one help, should be readily available.
